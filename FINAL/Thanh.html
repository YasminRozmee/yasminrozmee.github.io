    <h2>Thanh</h2> 
    <p>
      Congrats you got the mom of the group. .</p>
    <p> Thanh is the level headed, calm person in the group. If you were to ever meet her she is a mixture of socially awkward, bubble cheerfulness and a lot of cuteness with an accidental large spill of sarcasm and bad jokes. She's the kind of person that will laugh at her own jokes. Probably the most patient person ever. (According to Thanh, <i>"I generally don't get angry, I would just get sad and start crying"</i>) This girl is full of compassion and selflesness, she would help her friends or anyone in a heartbeat. She is kind and will always want to see the best in everyone </p>




    <p> <i><b>I believe in the act of being grateful, for all the things you get to see, to experience, to live and love.  - Thanh </i></b></p>

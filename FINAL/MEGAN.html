    <h2>Megan</h2> 
    <p>
      Congrats you got the mess of the group. .</p>
    <p> Megan is an example that it's okay to make mistakes, living life clumsily (or stupidly) as it helps you become the person you are today. She's a huge sap and loves to surround herself with people who make her a better person. She is AWKWARD but CARING AND PATIENT. She's basic AF, aims to live her life as <strong>simple</strong> as possible. </p>




    <p> <i><b>I think I'm a mess. I think life is too short to not do stupid things.  - Megan </i></b></p>

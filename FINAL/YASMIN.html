    <h2>Yasmin</h2> 
    <p>
      Congrats you got the <i>other</i> mess in the group. .</p>
    <p> Yasmin is your typical artsy yet pretentious friend. She's a huge sap herself and loves to surround herself with people who make her a better person. She is the <i>least</i> patient out of everyone in the group. If you were to meet her she may seem tiny and but don't let that fool you. She likes to indulge her time in face masks, movies and Friends. </p>




    <p> <i><b>Spending time on the materialistic aspects of life feels kind abysmal because capitalism? but at the same time rewarding because I forget about the many problems I have in my life. - Yasmin </i></b></p>

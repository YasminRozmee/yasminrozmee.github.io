    <h2>Corina</h2> 
    <p>
      Congrats you got the funny one in the group. .</p>
    <p> Corina is sassy, adventurous and passionate. She's a little weird... but probably the most open minded person you could ever meet. Corina loves trying new things (<i>according to her 'I like to think of myself as a TRYer</i>). One thing that's great about her is how passionate she is. You can talk to her about anything   </p>




    <p> <i><strong>A lot more optimistic than one would expect. I think you have to have hope to live and once you lose your thirst for a better tomorrow than you lose your will to live. Kind of dark but, you have to have darkness to see the light. - Corina </i></strong></p>

        <p> <i><strong>I'd probably hang out with Chrissy Teigen and play Animal Crossing with her</i></strong></p>

      >It's The Brunch Girls. We're a couple of stressed out college students. Yasmin, Megan, Corina & last but not least, Thanh. The Brunch Girls is a Lifestyle blog, think decadent routine brunches. It's a realistic place founded by our love for sharing stories with each other. Think squad meetings. Its a time for us to update each other with our lives everyday. Thoughts, ramblings. We hope to update the blog twice a week, from all of us. Why not? Because we are a million miles apart. This also hopes to encourage open conversation with others reading.
